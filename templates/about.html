    <h2>about cl alerts</h2>
    <p><i>This is the beta version of a craigslist monitoring tool that I have been playing around with in my spare time.  There are no garuntees as to the stability, security, or accuracy of the website and data.  Please take appropriate precautions.</i></p>
    <p>To use the site, signup for an account on the <a href="{{ url_for('signup') }}">sign up</a> page.  You will need to enter a unique user name and email.  The phone number is optional, but should be entered in the following format: <i>+1xxxyyyzzzz</i>, where xxx is your 3 digit area code, followed by your seven digit phone number.</p>
    <p>Once you have signed up, you will be directed to your home page.  Head over to the <a href="{{ url_for('newalert') }}">new alert</a> page to set up your first alert.  You will be asked for an alert name, this can be whatever you want.  For example, if I am searching for used cars under $2000, I might name my alert 'Cars under $2000'.  Don't worry too much about this though, as you can edit the alert configurations at any time.  The next required alert setting is the search page link.  This should be a direct link to the craigslist search.  So if you haven't already, go to the craigslist website, and set up your desired search (sub-categories, price restrictions, location restrictions, etc...) and then copy the address for the search results page and paste it into the text box. Follow the <a href="http://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/cta?zoomToPosting=&catAbb=cta&query=&minAsk=&maxAsk=2000&autoMinYear=&autoMaxYear=&autoMakeModel=&excats=">link</a> for an example search using the 'cars under $2000' criteria.  The next section is the alert interval.  This is the number of hours that you want between alerts.  So if you want fast and frequent updates, set the interval to 1-2 hours (the shortest allowable interval is 1 hour).  If you want less frequent updates, set the interval higher (12+ hours).  The system will only send you alerts if a new post has been detected and the requested interval length between alerts has passed.  Currently, you cannot set alerts for specific times (for example 9am everyday), this feature may be added later.  The next alert settings are the email and text message notification check boxes.  Check the box for your prefered method of notification (you can check both if you want).  Finally, hit the save settings button, which will save your alert configuarations and redirect you to the home page.</p>
    <p>Once you have an alert set up, we will start tracking the craigslist search results.  The site is checked hourly, and we will send you an alert when a new post is detected (and the requested alert interval has passed).  You can view the latest posts on your alert status page (click on the link to your alert on your home page).  You can have multiple alerts at once, so feel free to add as many as you like.  If you need to deactivate your alert, go to the alert status page (follow the link on the user home page), and then follow the edit alert link.  At the bottom of the edit alert page is s checkbox that allow you to deactivate the alert. </p>
    <p>Lastly, if you need to edit your user details, you can do so on the <a href="{{url_for('editprofile') }}">edit profile</a> page.  Hope this helps.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.</p>
